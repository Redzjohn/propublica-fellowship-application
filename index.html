    <h4>1. <a href="http://nyti.ms/1jvoEDv" target="_blank">The Premier League Standings if Only Goals by English Players Counted</a> | The New York Times</h4>
<p>This New York Times interactive feature is actually John’s <a href="http://bit.ly/1mLfXIy" target="_blank">school project</a> he created for the Data Journalism class at New York University taught by <a href="http://kpq.github.io/" target="_blank">Kevin Quealy</a> and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/amanda_cox/index.html" target="_blank">Amanda Cox</a>, two graphics editors at The New York Times. They kindly helped John publish the project on The Upshot, The Times’ news venture providing analysis and data visualizations about politics, policy and everyday life.</p>
<p>This soccer story hit 1.5 million pageviews and became the most read article on the entire New York Times site for its past 30 days due to its highly sharable nature. It was also featured on the <a href="http://bit.ly/1wgdFiH" target="_blank">front page</a> of The New York Times International Edition on May 11th, 2014.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of public dataset on Premier League players’ registered nationalities, John built his own dataset and manually calculated the new results of the entire 380 matches of the 2013-2014 season, in order to draw the modified Premier League standings.</p>

<h4>2. <a href="http://bit.ly/1qo7Twg" target="_blank">Total Recall - Visualizing Weibo Sensitive Words of the Year</a></h4>
<p>Inspired by ProPublica’s investigative feature on <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/weibo/" target="_blank">erased images from Sina Weibo</a>, John created this interactive project visualizing 494 censored search terms on Weibo throughout the year 2013. This project attempts to provide a more comprehensive insight of China’s Internet censorship trend including what, when and why certain words on Weibo are banned by the authority. John acquired all the data from The China Digital Times’ <a href="http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2013/06/grass-mud-horse-list/" target="_blank">Grass-Mud Horse List</a>, a crowdsourcing project which periodically collects sensitive Sina Weibo search terms from annonymus Internet users.</p>

<h4>3. <a href="http://bit.ly/1ACOTjd" target="_blank">A Visualization of Apple’s Q4 Earnings Report</a> | QDaily.com</h4>
<p>This project is not simply an article. John was hired by China’s top online news startup <a href="http://www.qdaily.com/" target="_blank">QDaily.com</a> as Digital Innovation Consultant to redesign the newsroom's data journalism workflow and equip every reporter with the skills to use mobile-friendly and dynamic charts to tell stories. In order to achieve this goal, John beta tested tech company Baidu's data visualization platform <a href="http://echarts.baidu.com/index-en.html" target="_blank">ECharts</a>, synced it with QDaily's content management system and trained journalists to work on its front end control panel collaboratively.</p>
<p>More importantly, John drafted a style guide illustrating all the tiniest details of chart specs with ECharts in different screen sizes, so the published pieces would look awesome on <a href="http://bit.ly/1xd60sJ" target="_blank">mobile</a>, too. This is one sample article produced under the new workflow, which achieved a 85% gain of work efficiency over the previous one.</p>

<h4>4. <a href="http://bit.ly/1xbYVZs" target="_blank">2013 NYC Mayoral Election Voting Map</a> | Bedford + Bowery</h4>
<p>This project is a collaboration of John and his classmates at New York University. They polled 318 New Yorkers living in Bedford & Bowery area about their views on the 2013 NYC Mayoral election, and plotted their responses on a map.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>1. <a href="http://bit.ly/posterfinder" target="_blank">Posterize</a></h4>
<p>John loves browsing movie posters, and hates it when Google brings him redundant images from inside movies as well. So he built this lightweight web app that allows him to search for all the posters from Star Wars’ 3 original series, 3 prequels, 3 (upcoming) sequels, 2+ featured documentaries, 4+ animated specials, 8+ cheap copycats…</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>

<p>John was visiting a dog park at Washington Square Park the day he first learned the term “cinemagraph”. That is the reason why his first cinemagraph is full of… dogs.</p>
